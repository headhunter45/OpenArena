	This program can be distributed under the GNU GPL with the following exception. I want to make this multiplayer compatible later on.  So any modifications that have anything to do with encryption or netcode don't have to be opensource as long as a copy of the source is sent to me to peruse and possibly add to the program (with applicable credit given).  Other than that OA will be open source hence the name.  Alternatively you can redistribute OA under the QTPL.
	If you would like to modify the source code all I want you to do is make the new source available includeing giving me a copy either by e-mail headhunter45@hotmail.com but I have the inbox protector on so make sure the subject line has something identifiable in it preferably even just OpenArena as a subject this is only necessary the first time or two you e-mail me so I can add you to my address book.  Also I have created a msn community you can post a link to the source in there and I'll download it myself (http://groups.msn.com/CodersCorner).
